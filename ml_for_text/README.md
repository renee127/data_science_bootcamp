This sentiment analysis project uses machine learning models to detect negative movie reviews with an F1 score of 0.88 (needs to be at least 0.85).

__Project Overview__
- The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews.
- They want a program to *automatically detect negative reviews*.
- Build and compare machine learning models for sentiment analysis.

__Data Description__
- A dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling.
- A tsv file (`imdb_reviews.tsv`) with review text and polarity label.

__Project Goal__
- Create a machine learning model that automatically detects negative reviews.
- AUC-ROC is the primary metric and needs to be at least 0.81, though greater than or equal to 0.88 is ideal.
- F1 score of at least 0.85.
